* Used Figma for developing user interface design
* User research before starting implementation
* Had interviews with two potential users to have project ideas on the process of user research
* Research and compared other similar applications(Klara and CVS) to make a difference with them
* Walkthrough a first (half-way done) prototype with two different users and updated based on their valuable feedback
* Heuristic evaluation with the team to help design enhance usability from early in development
* User Testing when it's all done to discover usability and design issues
